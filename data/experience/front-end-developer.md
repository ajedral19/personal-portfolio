In my previous role, I collaborated closely with the back-end and SEO team as a Web Designer/front-end developer. I was responsible for creating compelling visuals, including logos and social media campaigns, as well as developing responsive websites by converting designs from PSD to HTML. It was a great experience working on various products the company had to handle.
